1. We copied the friends app to another project.
2. Then, made a split view controller.
3. Delete all extra views and keep the biggest one there.
4. Connect the new split view controller to the other view controllers. 
5. Input view is the primary view controller and friends screen is the secondary.
6. Adjust text boxes to make them the right size.
7. Embed the primary view into a navigation controller.
8. Embed the other view in a navigation controller too.
9. Went into the controller and made the information go from the first navigation, to the
	split view, and then back down to the second navigation and then into the table view controller.
10. Adjusted the text boxes to fit into the screen.
11. Made sure that both of the screens worked and it was compatible for both iPad and iPhone.
12. We then made the UML diagram according to the classes and features that we implemented.
