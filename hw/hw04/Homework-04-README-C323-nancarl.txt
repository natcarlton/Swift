1) the parts of the assignment you have completed
I finished all parts of the assignment!

2) any extra functionality, particularly interesting code, etc. added to the code
I added some input handling for the contacts so that the user cannot enter an empty string for any of the name or email values. I also left in the example friends from the instructions so you can see what the table would look like without having to input a lot of data. I also made sure that the capitalization didn't matter when sorting. You also cannot input empty strings or a lot of spaces for the new friend; it will not add it to the table.

3) (optional) any question you may have about the tasks, and any issue you may have encountered with the software tools you used
No questions here!
