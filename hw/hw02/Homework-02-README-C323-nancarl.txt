1) the parts of the assignment you have completed
I finished all parts of the assignment!

2) any extra functionality, particularly interesting code, etc. added to the code
I was able to overwrite the viewDidAppear() function from the UIViewController class which is how I was able to get the history to load every time you go to the history tab. I also made it so only the new history would show up, i.e. the history that wasn't there the last time you visited the history tab.

3) any suggestions/enhancements you may have to improve the calculator
Maybe adding a clear history button could be easy to implement.

4) any question you may have about the tasks
I think this homework was a lot easier than the last homework. I think the hardest part was figuring out how to load the history on the page but after looking through the UIViewController documentation, I was able to find a function to override to make the history load every time you visit the page since there weren't any buttons to trigger the action of writing the history.
