1) the parts of the assignment you have completed
I finished all parts of the assignment!

2) any extra functionality, particularly interesting code, etc. added to the code
I made sure you couldn't divide by zero because that would make the app crash.

3) any suggestions/enhancements you may have to improve the calculator
Negative 0 doesn't make any sense, but I tried to implement it anyways to show the sign even though it doesn't matter in the calculation.

4) any question you may have about the tasks
I am still a bit confused about what is allowed in the controller logic wise. I think I did the proper things, but I am unsure.
